## Tasks

### Number generator
Create function "createCounter" to generate numbers. It should receive the start value, which by default is equal to 0.

For example:
```js
const counter = createCounter(44);
counter(); // 45
counter(); // 46
counter(); // 47
```

### Multiply
Create function "multiply" to multiple values as shown below.

For example:
```js
multiply(2)(4)(6); // 48
multiply(3)(3)(3); // 27 
```


Write your code in `src/index.js.
