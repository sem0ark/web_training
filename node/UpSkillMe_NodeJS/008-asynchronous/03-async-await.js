 * 
 * All in all async/await is just a syntactic sugar, so it is working in the same way as promises!
 * 
 * We can use them by defining function that returns a Promise with *async*
 *  and later use *await* to stop teh execution flow and get data from the asynchronous function.
 * 
 * The notation doesn't have thespecific error notation, but we can use try/catch functionality!
