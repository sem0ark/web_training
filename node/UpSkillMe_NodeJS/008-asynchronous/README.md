## Recap of the week

Let's recap everything you have learned this week.

First, you've understood what variable scope is and learnt how to define local, global, and block-scoped variables. Also, you've become familiar with closures. Second, you have figured out what a class and a constructor are and adsorbed how to declare classes, extend classes, and how to use mixins to extend the functionality of classes.

In addition, you have learned to write more efficient code using a prototype chain. And finally, you've become aware of three different approaches to handle asynchronous code such as callback functions, promises, and asynchronous functions. Thus, you can choose the best approach to handle your own asynchronous code.
