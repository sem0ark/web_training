### Introduction

TypeScript - superset of JS, it adds new features and syntax to JS.
It adds the concept of static typing for JS.

Dynamic vs. Static:

1. Great for web browser object model. Dynamic languages use duck typing (if it behaves like a duck, then it is a duck) and much more forgiving to the changes of types.
2. Great for maintainability and sustainability. Static typed languages force you to clearly specify what should do all the objects you use, we would be able to statically analyze the code without running it.

JS is now has much more functionality than it was first intended, so developers now think about its dynamic nature more as a curse.

TypeScript adds typing in JS and allows to more quickly analyze the code for errors. You don't always have to use typing, so it isn't really a constraint for coding. TypeScript is a transpiler that allows to use the latest ECMAScript standards, but allows to run the code anywhere.
