> 4. How can you do that?
> 5. What are your current resources?
> 6. What resources are required to get to point B?

>[!info]- Backpack
> Your friend Lucy tells you that she wants a backpack for her birthday. You decide to give her a backpack as a present, but in order to meet her expectations for the backpack, you need to understand what she needs it for.
> 1. Maybe she decided to start hiking?
> 2. If yes, how much stuff does Lucy plan to take with her?
> 3. Or maybe Lucy will use it every day?
> 4. What does she plan to put into the backpack?
> 5. Which materials does she prefer and why?
> 
> Basically, by asking Lucy these (and many other) questions, you will figure out Lucy's requirements for the backpack and help her to move from her current state, where she does not have a backpack, to her future state, where she has a backpack. You will work out a strategy of how to make a valuable change for Lucy.
