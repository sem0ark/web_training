The world of a Business Analyst is full of new technologies, innovative solutions, and best-in-class tools.

#### Types of applications

>[!info]- Web application
> A **web application** is accessible via a browser, so a laptop, a tablet or a smartphone can open it.
> 
> Anyone with the Internet service can access a web application which is considered to be its main advantage. 
> 
> Further to that, a web application can run on multiple platforms regardless of the operating system.
> 
> Limitations:
> 1. A web application is more vulnerable to security attacks than a desktop one.
> 2. A web application might not be supported by all browsers. Additional time and investment are required to add cross-browser support to the application.
>  
> The examples: Google Docs, Trello, Netflix, Gmail.
> 
> Web applications are very popular because they can offer enough capabilities to satisfy business needs and attract a wider landscape of end users.
> Also, the use of a web application increases the chances that a user will try it out, as it does not require installation that is usually associated with extra effort.

>[!info]- Mobile application
> A **mobile application** is a program that can be downloaded and installed on a smartphone or a tablet using application directories (for example, Google Play, Apple Store).
> 
> The main benefit -> it can access all features that modern devices have, such as GPS, a camera, Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (NFC), and many more.
> 
> Types of mobile applications:
> 1. Native
> 	- Written in the native programming language of a device.
> 	- Offer the best user experience and the highest performance.
> 	- Can't offer a cross-platform experience.
> 2. Hybrid
> 	- Possesses the features of both a web application and a native application.
> 	- Provides cross-platform capabilities.
> 	- Lower performance in comparison to native ones.

>[!info]- Desktop application
> A **desktop application** is an application that is installed on a computer.
> 1. More secure in comparison to a web application that is exposed to a large number of users.
> 2. Standalone in nature; that is why they do not rely on Internet connectivity and speed.
> 3. Usually faster.

### Application Creation Process
Creating an application is a complex process presented as a set of activities needed to *transform an idea into a product available on the market*.


>[!tip]- Ideation
> The purpose of the ideation phase is to come up with ideas for a potential product and select the best one that will be further worked on.
> It is high time to apply creative thinking and suggest groundbreaking ideas.
> 
> All the identified ideas should be captured and evaluated to find the one that is worth investments.
> 
> Ideation is an engaging and productive process.

>[!tip]- Conception
> In order to shape the product concept, a creative idea should be backed up by additional research and analysis.
> 
> The organization conducts the market assessment to understand the market gap, identify potential customers, and make projections on how successful the product will be.
> 
> The main goal of the conception phase is to make a go/no-go decision about the product.
> Further to that, the cost-benefit analysis is carried out to support the decision-making process.

>[!tip]- Elaboration
> The elaboration phase includes planning and requirements-related activities.
> The purpose of this phase is to define
> - what functionalities should be included in the product;
> - what user tasks it will be able to solve.

>[!tip]- Design
> As a part of this phase:
> - baseline architecture will be described and documented. 
> - provide us with a basic understanding of how the product will look, its visual design concepts, and the main user flows.
> 
> In addition, it will become clearer whether all components will be created by the development team or maybe some of them will be purchased elsewhere.

>[!tip]- Development
> In the development phase, the system will be created and tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and user needs.
> 
> Nowadays, the system is developed in small parts. Each part is separately tested and integrated with other parts, so it is more flexible to changes or adjustments.


>[!tip]- Introduction
> The introduction phase means that the product will be available to a wider audience.
> The product release should be supported by many departments in the organization to ensure that everything goes smoothly.
> 
> - The marketing department -> finalize key marketing documentation (position, messaging, and competitive differentiation)
> - The sales department -> prepare the product's white papers, product demos, price lists, sales contracts.
> - Customer support -> train to be able to answer the questions from end users.

Sometimes a company may choose a **soft launch** to test the functionality of an application, allowing adjustments to be introduced before a wider release.

It gets obvious that if the aforementioned phases occur in the sequential order (where one phase finishes and the next one starts), it will hardly satisfy the fast-changing market. That is why, companies create a **minimum viable product** (MVP) -> a basic version of the product that covers the core requirements and needs of end users.

In addition, the release of an MVP will make it possible to understand whether the product will find its place in the market or whether improvements are needed.

The post-MVP functionality is prioritized for future releases.

#### People participating in product's development

1. *Product Owner / PO* -> being the voice of a customer in the team. 
	1. Makes key decisions,
	2. defines the next priorities,
	3. ensures that the value is constantly delivered,
	4. gathers product-related feedback.
2. *Business Analyst / BA* -> eliciting, documenting, and approving requirements.
	1. ensures that the product will satisfy business and user needs.
3. *Developer* is responsible for producing clean and efficient code.
	1. Back-End Dev -> the internal world of an application:
		1. application logic,
		2. database,
		3. integrations,
		4. other back-end processes.
	2. Front-End Dev -> the visual design of an application and its interactive elements.
	3. A Full-Stack Dev -> the skills of both.
4. *Tester* -> preparing and executing test cases.
	1. Ensure that the quality of a system is high enough to support user operations.
5. *DevOps Engineer* -> building, testing, and maintaining infrastructure to develop and release a product in a fast and efficient manner.
6. *System Architect* -> create and document the architectural vision of the system.
	1. Ensure that the system design supports long-term business objectives.
7. *UI/UX Designer* -> create the look and feel of the system: visual concepts, interface elements, user flows, etc.

> A product *CAN* be developed without a Business Analyst; however, it *CAN'T EVER* be developed without business analysis.

#### BA's Journey from Ideation to Introduction
Being a Business Analyst means that you will be engaged in the product development as early as possible and will keep working on it till its introduction to the market or even after.
