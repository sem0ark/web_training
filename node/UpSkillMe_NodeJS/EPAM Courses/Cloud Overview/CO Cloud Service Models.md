The most common cloud service models are:
>[!info]- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
> It provides access to the hardware needed to run applications.
> IaaS essentially replicates a data center using on-prem legacy hardware in a cloud.
> This model requires infrastructure engineers and architects who will be deeply involved in the development and maintenance of the cloud.
> 
> Examples of IaaS services:
> - Cisco
> - Microsoft Azure
> - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
> - Google Compute Engine (GCE)
> - Digital Ocean

>[!info]- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
> Platform as a service offers an additional layer of abstraction over IaaS, providing necessary components beyond infrastructure.
> The platform layer typically includes:
> - operating systems
> - pre-built development tools
> - testing
> - runtime
> - middleware
> - databases.
> 
> So developers can focus on functionality that adds business value.
> 
> Examples of PaaS services:
> - Azure App Service
> - Salesforce.com
> - Google App Engine
> - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
> - OpenShift

>[!info]- Software as a Service (SaaS)
> Software as a service delivers an entire software stack to users, who typically just pay for the subscription. The SaaS model requires no application coding and no hosting infrastructure.
> The provider is 100% responsible for system updates, security, and any other essential tasks.
> Examples of SaaS services:
> - Google apps (i.e., Gmail or Google Maps)
> - Dropbox
> - Salesforce
> - YouTube
> - Concur
> - GoToMeeting
> - MS Office 365

- In Iaas, the vendor manages only hardware and virtualization, leaving the rest up to you.
- In Paas, you manage configuration, functionality, and scaling, but your vendor operates other things.
- In Saas, users have access to a whole software stack for the price of a subscription. You only manage the configuration

A simple way to help differentiate the different service models is to think of them as a pizza party. Each service model provides a different experience for your organization.
