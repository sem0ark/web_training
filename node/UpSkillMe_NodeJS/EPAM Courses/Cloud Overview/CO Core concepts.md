## Cloud Core Concepts
Cloud technology  is now an integral part of a business model that is taking over the world. Besides allowing businesses to store and access data, cloud computing changes how large and small businesses work.

*Cloud* - provides a way of abstracting, pooling, and sharing computing resources—like servers, switches, routers, operating systems, and security software—across a network of devices on or off the premises.

*Cloud computing* (CC) refers to the use of these resources over the Internet.
1. Users rent computational resources like storage space or CPU power
2. the cloud provider actively manages the hardware (e.g. storage drives and servers) that provide those computational resources. 

They also offer higher level services that:
- analyze data
- support disaster recovery
- act as development environments

It may be helpful to think of the cloud as *a massive utility like a water or electricity service*. With the cloud, you also have an up-front contract and pay based on the amount of cloud resources you consume.

In the real world, utilities serve certain purposes, and so does the cloud in business.
*Cloud projects* strive to adopt cloud technologies as much as possible to achieve business goals. To make the most of cloud functionality, companies engage *cloud specialists* to see to the technological aspects of working with clouds and help solve business problems.

In contrast to your typical utilities, the cloud leverages a mixture of technologies such as an operating system, a management platform, and APIs. Each of these technologies includes the option to use virtualization and automation software. As a result, there are hundreds of *different cloud resource types* and multiple options for each.

#### Benefits of CC
>[!success]- Cost Efficiency
> Cloud computing provides a pay-as-you-go or consumption-based pricing model. These benefits help organizations minimize financial risk, especially when starting a project.

>[!success]- Scalability
> Scalability - ability to increase or decrease IT resources as needed
> *Vertical scaling* - increasing the size of each resource.
> *Horizontal scaling* - adding more resources to your existing clusters.

>[!success]- Elasticity
> The ability to provide or remove resources on demand as your organization's needs change.

>[!success]- Variety
> Cloud provider services can vary significantly and encompass a wide variety of capabilities.

>[!success]- Reliability
> Cloud computing providers offer data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication services to make sure your data is always safe.

>[!success]- Security
> Cloud providers help your organization maintain a high level of security.


#### Deployment models
Maximizing the benefits of the cloud requires choosing the correct cloud model for your workloads and data.

>[!info]- Private Cloud
> A private cloud's capacity is static, based on how much storage has been paid for; it can be run internally or by an independent contractor.
> Used as a bridge to Public Cloud

>[!info]- Public Cloud
> Public clouds are run by a specialist provider in their data centers and are accessible via the internet or private connections. They do not require an independent data center space for system maintenance or the purchase of hardware or software.

>[!info]- Hybrid Cloud
> Hybrid clouds are computing environments that use a mixture of on-premises data storage, private cloud, and third-party public cloud services.

>[!info]- Multi-cloud
> Multi-cloud is a strategy in which multiple computing and storage services are used in a single architecture.
> It aims to distribute workload across several cloud-hosting environments, eliminating the need to rely on a single provider.
> This approach differs from a hybrid cloud in that the cloud services can function either independently or together, as opposed to multiple types of infrastructure functioning collectively

The type of deployment model you select should be based on:
- the number of programs you want to run
- how much storage space you need
- your organizational aims

#### Customer needs

>[!info]- Consumer Cloud
> Cloud computing services for personal use, such as Dropbox or iCloud

>[!info]- Vertical Cloud
> for the needs of business sectors such as healthcare, financial services, and government operations

>[!info]- External Cloud
> Public or private cloud services provided by a third party outside of an organization

>[!info]- Internal Cloud
> A private cloud instance provided and supported by an organization's IT department for internal use
