Good afternoon, I wanted to ask some questions related to the course UpSkillMe Node.js:
1. Are there any deadlines to the tasks and courses in EPAM UpSkillMe_Node.js?
2. On which subject we should now be?
3. How to send the completed practice tasks to the mentor? Should I appoint a consultation or send it somewhere?
4. There is an issue with Discord:
  1. After logging in from the invite URL I get into the web version of Discord, PC version also shows that I am logged into the group.
  2. But, after closing the web version, I am getting logged out from the group: it disappears from the list of accessible groups.

Thank you in advance for your answer!
Sincerely,
Arkadii Semenov
