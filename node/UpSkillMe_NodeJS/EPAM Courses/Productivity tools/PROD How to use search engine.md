Searching for information is one of the most important digital literacy skills. As an IT specialist, you will often find a need to search for information about technologies and best practices.

>[!info]- Search on a specific website
> Use "site:" operator to tell Google to search only on a specific site. For example, the search “site:wikipedia.org Ethernet” returns the results of the search “Ethernet” which are only on the wikidepia.org.

>[!info]- Search for a specific file type
> Use "filetype:" operator to narrow the results to a specific file type. For example, you might want to search only for pdfs because you need full specification on something or some standard, but not an article on a website.

>[!info] Use quotes to search for an exact match.

>[!info]- Exclude words
> Put a minus symbol in front of the word you want to leave out. Note: Some time ago the plus sign was used to identify the words that must be in the results of the search, but it does not work like that anymore. Use quotes to force include a single word.

>[!info] Logical operatiors
> Normally all words entered in a search query are treated as if they are separated by AND operator. Use OR operator if you want/need any of the words.

If you need information about a *specific command line* tool, sometimes it is better to use built-in documentation for that tool rather than search the web. This documentation is often called *man* pages (short for a manual page).

Although the amount of information in the official documentation may seem overwhelming at first, you should get used to it because it is the most authoritative source of information for programming languages.
