### Software Licenses
You probably heard about open-source software and different names of licenses like:
- MIT license,
- Apache license,
- GNU GPL,
- BSD license.

A **software license** is a contract between the author of an application, source code, or a related product, and its end user.

- **Proprietary** – also known as “closed source”. A typical proprietary software license gives a user rights to use the software, but it does not allow modification, redistribution, and sublicensing.
- **Free and open-source software (FOSS)** – also known as “open source”. Under the FOSS license, a user is typically allowed to use, modify, redistribute, and sometimes sublicense the software.

It must be noted that software without any license should be considered as copyright protected by default. Therefore, if there is no license included, software is legally unusable in any way. The only exclusion to this rule is if software is placed in the public domain by explicit note included in this software or because the rights have expired or have been forfeited.

The FOSS licenses, on the other hand, are often classified into two main categories:
- **Copyleft** – Other people can use, modify, and share their work based on licensed code if the new code is distributed under the same license.
- **Permissive** – Under this type of a license, there are a few restrictions on the distribution or modification of software. It allows proprietary derivative works if an appropriate license is included in the distribution.
